description = Adds some native functionality on the Win32 platform (makes the taskbar entry blink when a message is received, and adds a system tray icon).  It requires msvcr71.dll and jawt.dll to be in your c:\windows\system32 directory.  You can find msvcr71.dll here: http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcr71 and you should be able to find jawt.dll by searching for it on your computer.
